        <h1>Why Cats Are Cool</h1>

        <p>
            Cats spend 30 to 50 percent of their day grooming themselves. Are you that clean? 
            This behavior serves several purposes: It helps cats tone down their scent so they 
            can avoid predators, it cools them down, it promotes blood flow, 
            and it distributes natural oils evenly around their coat, allowing them to stay warm 
            and dry. Grooming also serves as a sign of affection between two cats, and it’s 
            thought that saliva contains enzymes that serve as a natural antibiotic for wounds.

        <p>
            A cat's nose has catnip receptors. Ever wonder why catnip lulls felines into a trance? 
            The herb contains several chemical compounds, including one called nepetalactone, which 
            a cat detects with receptors in its nose and mouth. The compounds trigger the typical odd 
            behaviors you associate with the wacky kitty weed, including sniffing, head shaking,
             head rubbing, and rolling around on the ground.

        <p>
            Cats make great private detectives. Can’t afford a private eye? A feline might be able 
            do the job for free. In the 1960s, ambassador Henry Helb—who then lived in the Dutch 
            Embassy in Moscow—noticed that his two Siamese kitties were arching their backs and 
            clawing at one of the walls. Helb had a hunch that the cats heard something he couldn’t, 
            and sure enough, he found 30 tiny microphones hidden behind the boards. Instead of 
            busting the spies, Helb and his staff took advantage of the surveillance and griped 
            about household repairs or packages stuck in customs while standing in front of the 
            mics. The eavesdroppers took care of their complaints—and apart from Helb and his 
            companions, no one was the wiser.
